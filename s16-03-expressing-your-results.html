        <h2 class="title editable block">Presenting Descriptive Statistics in Writing</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="price_1.0-ch12_s03_s01_p01">When you have a small number of results to report, it is often most efficient to write them out. There are a few important APA style guidelines here. First, statistical results are always presented in the form of numerals rather than words and are usually rounded to two decimal places (e.g., “2.00” rather than “two” or “2”). They can be presented either in the narrative description of the results or parenthetically—much like reference citations. Here are some examples:</p>
        <span class="blockquote block" id="price_1.0-ch12_s03_s01_bl01">
            <p class="para editable" id="price_1.0-ch12_s03_s01_p02">The mean age of the participants was 22.43 years with a standard deviation of 2.34.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Presenting Descriptive Statistics in Graphs</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="price_1.0-ch12_s03_s02_p01">When you have a large number of results to report, you can often do it more clearly and efficiently with a graph. When you prepare graphs for an APA-style research report, there are some general guidelines that you should keep in mind. First, the graph should always add important information rather than repeat information that already appears in the text or in a table. (If a graph presents information more clearly or efficiently, then you should keep the graph and eliminate the text or table.) Second, graphs should be as simple as possible. For example, the <em class="emphasis">Publication Manual</em> discourages the use of color unless it is absolutely necessary (although color can still be an effective element in posters, slide show presentations, or textbooks.) Third, graphs should be interpretable on their own. A reader should be able to understand the basic result based only on the graph and its caption and should not have to refer to the text for an explanation.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="price_1.0-ch12_s03_s02_p02">There are also several more technical guidelines for graphs that include the following:</p>

This emphasizes the fundamental similarity of the two types of statistical relationship. Both are differences in the average score on one variable across levels of another. The convention followed by most researchers, however, is to use a bar graph when the variable plotted on the <em class="emphasis">x-</em>axis is categorical and a line graph when it is quantitative.</p>

First, when the variables on the <em class="emphasis">x-</em>axis and <em class="emphasis">y</em>-axis are conceptually similar and measured on the same scale—as here, where they are measures of the same variable on two different occasions—this can be emphasized by making the axes the same length.

        <p class="para editable block" id="price_1.0-ch12_s03_s03_p01">Like graphs, tables can be used to present large amounts of information clearly and efficiently. The same general principles apply to tables as apply to graphs. They should add important information to the presentation of your results, be as simple as possible, and be interpretable on their own. Again, we focus here on tables for an APA-style manuscript.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="price_1.0-ch12_s03_s03_p02">The most common use of tables is to present several means and standard deviations—usually for complex research designs with multiple independent and dependent variables. <a class="xref" href="#price_1.0-ch12_s03_s03_f01">Figure 12.15 "Sample APA-Style Table Presenting Means and Standard Deviations"</a>, for example, shows the results of a hypothetical study similar to the one by MacDonald and Martineau (2002)<span class="footnote" id="price_1.0-fn12_006">MacDonald, T.

(The means in <a class="xref" href="#price_1.0-ch12_s03_s03_f01">Figure 12.15 "Sample APA-Style Table Presenting Means and Standard Deviations"</a> are the means reported by MacDonald and Martineau, but the standard errors are not). Recall that these researchers categorized participants as having low or high self-esteem, put them into a negative or positive mood, and measured their intentions to have unprotected sex. Although not mentioned in <a class="xref" href="price_1.0-ch05#price_1.0-ch05">Chapter 5 "Psychological Measurement"</a>, they also measured participants’ attitudes toward unprotected sex. Notice that the table includes horizontal lines spanning the entire table at the top and bottom, and just beneath the column headings. Furthermore, every column has a heading—including the leftmost column—and there are additional headings that span two or more columns that help to organize the information and present it more efficiently. Finally, notice that APA-style tables are numbered consecutively starting at 1 (Table 1, Table 2, and so on) and given a brief but clear and descriptive title.</p>

Notice here that only half the table is filled in because the other half would have identical values. For example, the Pearson’s <em class="emphasis">r</em> value in the upper right corner (working memory and age) would be the same as the one in the lower left corner (age and working memory).
