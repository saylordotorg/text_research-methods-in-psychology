    <p class="para editable block" id="price_1.0-ch03_s02_p01">The general moral principles of weighing risks against benefits, acting with integrity, seeking justice, and respecting people’s rights and dignity provide a useful starting point for thinking about the ethics of psychological research because essentially everyone agrees on them. As we have seen, however, even people who agree on these general principles can disagree about specific ethical issues that arise in the course of conducting research. This is why there also exist more detailed and enforceable ethics codes that provide guidance on important issues that arise frequently. In this section, we begin with a brief historical overview of such ethics codes and then look closely at the one that is most relevant to psychological research—that of the American Psychological Association (APA).</p>
    <div class="section" id="price_1.0-ch03_s02_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Historical Overview</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="price_1.0-ch03_s02_s01_p01">One of the earliest ethics codes was the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Nuremberg Code</a><span class="glossdef">An early ethics code for research with human participants that was written in conjunction with the trials of accused Nazi war criminals after World War II.</span></span>—a set of 10 principles written in 1947 in conjunction with the trials of Nazi physicians accused of shockingly cruel research on concentration camp prisoners during World War II. It provided a standard against which to compare the behavior of the men on trial—many of whom were eventually convicted and either imprisoned or sentenced to death. The Nuremberg Code was particularly clear about the importance of carefully weighing risks against benefits and the need for informed consent. The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Declaration of Helsinki</a><span class="glossdef">An ethics code for biomedical research with human participants written by the World Medical Council in 1964 and last updated in 2004.</span></span> is a similar ethics code that was created by the World Medical Council in 1964. Among the standards that it added to the Nuremberg Code was that research with human participants should be based on a written <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">protocol</a><span class="glossdef">A detailed written description of a research project that can be reviewed by an independent committee to evaluate its conformity to ethical standards.</span></span>—a detailed description of the research—that is reviewed by an independent committee. The Declaration of Helsinki has been revised several times, most recently in 2004.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="price_1.0-ch03_s02_s01_p02">In the United States, concerns about the Tuskegee study and others led to the publication in 1978 of a set of federal guidelines called the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Belmont Report</a><span class="glossdef">A set of ethical standards for research with human participants published by the US Department of Health and Human Services in 1978.</span></span>. The Belmont Report explicitly recognized the principle of seeking justice, including the importance of conducting research in a way that distributes risks and benefits fairly across different groups at the societal level. The Belmont Report became the basis of a set of laws—the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects</a><span class="glossdef">A set of federal regulations for research with human participants based in part on the Belmont Report.</span></span>—that apply to research conducted, supported, or regulated by the federal government. An extremely important part of these regulations is that universities, hospitals, and other institutions that receive support from the federal government must establish an <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">institutional review board (IRB)</a><span class="glossdef">A committee at a university, a hospital, or another institution that reviews research protocols to be sure they conform to ethical standards.</span></span>—a committee that is responsible for reviewing research protocols for potential ethical problems. An IRB must consist of at least five people with varying backgrounds, including members of different professions, scientists and nonscientists, men and women, and at least one person not otherwise affiliated with the institution. The IRB helps to make sure that the risks of the proposed research are minimized, the benefits outweigh the risks, the research is carried out in a fair manner, and the informed consent procedure is adequate.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="price_1.0-ch03_s02_s01_p03">The federal regulations also distinguish research that poses three levels of risk. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Exempt research</a><span class="glossdef">Extremely low-risk research that is exempt from the Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects.</span></span> includes research on the effectiveness of normal educational activities, the use of standard psychological measures and surveys of a nonsensitive nature that are administered in a way that maintains confidentiality, and research using existing data from public sources. It is called exempt because the regulations do not apply to it. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Minimal risk research</a><span class="glossdef">Research that exposes participants to risks that are no greater than those encountered by healthy people in daily life or during routine physical or psychological examinations.</span></span> exposes participants to risks that are no greater than those encountered by healthy people in daily life or during routine physical or psychological examinations. Minimal risk research can receive an expedited review by one member of the IRB or by a separate committee under the authority of the IRB that can only approve minimal risk research. (Many departments of psychology have such separate committees.) Finally, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">at-risk research</a><span class="glossdef">Research that exposes participants to risks that are greater than those encountered by healthy people in daily life or during routine physical or psychological examinations.</span></span> poses greater than minimal risk and must be reviewed by the IRB.</p>

It includes about 150 specific ethical standards that psychologists and their students are expected to follow. Much of the APA Ethics Code concerns the clinical practice of psychology—advertising one’s services, setting and collecting fees, having personal relationships with clients, and so on. For our purposes, the most relevant part is <em class="emphasis">Standard 8: Research and Publication</em>. Although <em class="emphasis">Standard 8</em> is reproduced here in its entirety, we should consider some of its most important aspects—informed consent, deception, debriefing, the use of nonhuman animal subjects, and scholarly integrity—in more detail.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Informed Consent</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="price_1.0-ch03_s02_s02_s01_p01">Standards 8.02 to 8.05 are about informed consent. Again, informed consent means obtaining and documenting people’s agreement to participate in a study, having informed them of everything that might reasonably be expected to affect their decision. This includes details of the procedure, the risks and benefits of the research, the fact that they have the right to decline to participate or to withdraw from the study, the consequences of doing so, and any legal limits to confidentiality. For example, some states require researchers who learn of child abuse or other crimes to report this information to authorities.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="price_1.0-ch03_s02_s02_s01_p02">Although the process of obtaining informed consent often involves having participants read and sign a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">consent form</a><span class="glossdef">A form that participants sign as part of the informed consent process. It describes the procedure, the risks and benefits, participants’ right to withdraw from the study, and any confidentiality issues.</span></span>, it is important to understand that this is not all it is. Although having participants read and sign a consent form might be enough when they are competent adults with the necessary ability and motivation, many participants do not actually read consent forms or read them but do not understand them. For example, participants often mistake consent forms for legal documents and mistakenly believe that by signing them they give up their right to sue the researcher (Mann, 1994).<span class="footnote" id="price_1.0-fn03_009">Mann, T. (1994). Informed consent for psychological research: Do subjects comprehend consent forms and understand their legal rights? <em class="emphasis">Psychological Science, 5</em>, 140–143.</span> Even with competent adults, therefore, it is good practice to tell participants about the risks and benefits, demonstrate the procedure, ask them if they have questions, and remind them of their right to withdraw at any time—in addition to having them read and sign a consent form.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="price_1.0-ch03_s02_s02_s01_p03">Note also that there are situations in which informed consent is not necessary. These include situations in which the research is not expected to cause any harm and the procedure is straightforward or the study is conducted in the context of people’s ordinary activities. For example, if you wanted to sit outside a public building and observe whether people hold the door open for people behind them, you would not need to obtain their informed consent. Similarly, if a college instructor wanted to compare two legitimate teaching methods across two sections of his research methods course, he would not need to obtain informed consent from his students.</p>

Deception also includes not informing participants of the full design or true purpose of the research even if they are not actively misinformed (Sieber, Iannuzzo, &amp; Rodriguez, 1995).<span class="footnote" id="price_1.0-fn03_010">Sieber, J. E., Iannuzzo, R., &amp; Rodriguez, B. (1995). Deception methods in psychology: Have they changed in 23 years? <em class="emphasis">Ethics &amp; Behavior, 5</em>, 67–85.</span> For example, a study on incidental learning—learning without conscious effort—might involve having participants read through a list of words in preparation for a “memory test” later. Although participants are likely to assume that the memory test will require them to recall the words, it might instead require them to recall the contents of the room or the appearance of the research assistant.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="price_1.0-ch03_s02_s02_s02_p02">Some researchers have argued that deception of research participants is rarely if ever ethically justified. Among their arguments are that it prevents participants from giving truly informed consent, fails to respect their dignity as human beings, has the potential to upset them, makes them distrustful and therefore less honest in their responding, and damages the reputation of researchers in the field (Baumrind, 1985).<span class="footnote" id="price_1.0-fn03_011">Baumrind, D. (1985). Research using intentional deception: Ethical issues revisited. <em class="emphasis">American Psychologist, 40</em>, 165–174.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="price_1.0-ch03_s02_s02_s02_p03">Note, however, that the APA Ethics Code takes a more moderate approach—allowing deception when the benefits of the study outweigh the risks, participants cannot reasonably be expected to be harmed, the research question cannot be answered without the use of deception, and participants are informed about the deception as soon as possible. This approach acknowledges that not all forms of deception are equally bad. Compare, for example, Milgram’s study in which he deceived his participants in several significant ways that resulted in their experiencing severe psychological stress with an incidental learning study in which a “memory test” turns out to be slightly different from what participants were expecting. It also acknowledges that some scientifically and socially important research questions can be difficult or impossible to answer without deceiving participants. Knowing that a study concerns the extent to which they obey authority, act aggressively toward a peer, or help a stranger is likely to change the way people behave so that the results no longer generalize to the real world.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Debriefing</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="price_1.0-ch03_s02_s02_s03_p01">Standard 8.08 is about <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">debriefing</a><span class="glossdef">The process of informing research participants after a study of the purpose of the study, revealing any deception, and minimizing any harm that might have occurred.</span></span>. This is the process of informing research participants as soon as possible of the purpose of the study, revealing any deception, and correcting any other misconceptions they might have as a result of participating. Debriefing also involves minimizing harm that might have occurred. For example, an experiment on the effects of being in a sad mood on memory might involve inducing a sad mood in participants by having them think sad thoughts, watch a sad video, or listen to sad music. Debriefing would be the time to return participants’ moods to normal by having them think happy thoughts, watch a happy video, or listen to happy music.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Nonhuman Animal Subjects</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="price_1.0-ch03_s02_s02_s04_p01">Standard 8.09 is about the humane treatment and care of nonhuman animal subjects. Although most contemporary research in psychology does not involve nonhuman animal subjects, a significant minority of it does—especially in the study of learning and conditioning, behavioral neuroscience, and the development of drug and surgical therapies for psychological disorders.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="price_1.0-ch03_s02_s02_s04_p02">The use of nonhuman animal subjects in psychological research is like the use of deception in that there are those who argue that it is rarely, if ever, ethically acceptable (Bowd &amp; Shapiro, 1993).<span class="footnote" id="price_1.0-fn03_012">Bowd, A. D., &amp; Shapiro, K. J. (1993). The case against animal laboratory research in psychology. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Social Issues, 49</em>, 133–142.</span> Clearly, nonhuman animals are incapable of giving informed consent. Yet they can be subjected to numerous procedures that are likely to cause them suffering. They can be confined, deprived of food and water, subjected to pain, operated on, and ultimately euthanized. (Of course, they can also be observed benignly in natural or zoolike settings.) Others point out that psychological research on nonhuman animals has resulted in many important benefits to humans, including the development of behavioral therapies for many disorders, more effective pain control methods, and antipsychotic drugs (Miller, 1985).<span class="footnote" id="price_1.0-fn03_013">Miller, N. E. (1985). The value of behavioral research on animals. <em class="emphasis">American Psychologist, 40</em>, 423–440.</span> It has also resulted in benefits to nonhuman animals, including alternatives to shooting and poisoning as means of controlling them.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="price_1.0-ch03_s02_s02_s04_p03">As with deception, the APA acknowledges that the benefits of research on nonhuman animals can outweigh the costs, in which case it is ethically acceptable. However, researchers must use alternative methods when they can. When they cannot, they must acquire and care for their subjects humanely and minimize the harm to them. For more information on the APA’s position on nonhuman animal subjects, see the website of the APA’s Committee on Animal Research and Ethics (<a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.apa.org/science/leadership/care/index.aspx">http://www.apa.org/science/leadership/care/index.aspx</a>).</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Scholarly Integrity</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="price_1.0-ch03_s02_s02_s05_p01">Standards 8.10 to 8.15 are about scholarly integrity. These include the obvious points that researchers must not fabricate data or plagiarize. Plagiarism means using others’ words or ideas without proper acknowledgment. Proper acknowledgment generally means indicating direct quotations with quotation marks <em class="emphasis">and</em> providing a citation to the source of any quotation or idea used.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="price_1.0-ch03_s02_s02_s05_p02">The remaining standards make some less obvious but equally important points. Researchers should not publish the same data a second time as though it were new, they should share their data with other researchers, and as peer reviewers they should keep the unpublished research they review confidential. Note that the authors’ names on published research—and the order in which those names appear—should reflect the importance of each person’s contribution to the research. It would be unethical, for example, to include as an author someone who had made only minor contributions to the research (e.g., analyzing some of the data) or for a faculty member to make himself or herself the first author on research that was largely conducted by a student.</p>

                    <li>There are several written ethics codes for research with human participants that provide specific guidance on the ethical issues that arise most frequently. These codes include the Nuremberg Code, the Declaration of Helsinki, the Belmont Report, and the Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects.</li>
                    <li>The APA Ethics Code is the most important ethics code for researchers in psychology. It includes many standards that are relevant mainly to clinical practice, but <em class="emphasis">Standard 8</em> concerns informed consent, deception, debriefing, the use of nonhuman animal subjects, and scholarly integrity in research.</li>
                    <li>Research conducted at universities, hospitals, and other institutions that receive support from the federal government must be reviewed by an institutional review board (IRB)—a committee at the institution that reviews research protocols to make sure they conform to ethical standards.</li>
                    <li>Informed consent is the process of obtaining and documenting people’s agreement to participate in a study, having informed them of everything that might reasonably be expected to affect their decision. Although it often involves having them read and sign a consent form, it is not equivalent to reading and signing a consent form.</li>
                    <li>Although some researchers argue that deception of research participants is never ethically justified, the APA Ethics Code allows for its use when the benefits of using it outweigh the risks, participants cannot reasonably be expected to be harmed, there is no way to conduct the study without deception, and participants are informed of the deception as soon as possible.</li>
