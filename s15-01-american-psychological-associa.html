        <p class="para editable block" id="price_1.0-ch11_s01_s01_p01"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">APA style</a><span class="glossdef">A set of guidelines for writing in psychology and related fields that are set down in the <em class="emphasis">Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association</em>.</span></span> is a set of guidelines for writing in psychology and related fields. These guidelines are set down in the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm"><em class="emphasis">Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association</em></a><span class="glossdef">A book published by the American Psychological Association that contains all the guidelines of APA style. It is often just referred to as the <em class="emphasis">Publication Manual</em>.</span></span> (APA, 2006).<span class="footnote" id="price_1.0-fn11_002">American Psychological Association. (2006). <em class="emphasis">Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association</em> (6th ed.). Washington, DC: American Psychological Association.</span> The <em class="emphasis">Publication Manual</em> originated in 1929 as a short journal article that provided basic standards for preparing manuscripts to be submitted for publication (Bentley et al., 1929).<span class="footnote" id="price_1.0-fn11_003">Bentley, M., Peerenboom, C. A., Hodge, F. W., Passano, E. B., Warren, H. C., &amp; Washburn, M. F. (1929). Instructions in regard to preparation of manuscript. <em class="emphasis">Psychological Bulletin, 26</em>, 57–63.</span> It was later expanded and published as a book by the association and is now in its sixth edition. The primary purpose of APA style is to facilitate scientific communication by promoting clarity of expression and by standardizing the organization and content of research articles and book chapters. It is easier to write about research when you know what information to present, the order in which to present it, and even the style in which to present it. Likewise, it is easier to read about research when it is presented in familiar and expected ways.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="price_1.0-ch11_s01_s01_p02">APA style is best thought of as a “genre” of writing that is appropriate for presenting the results of psychological research—especially in academic and professional contexts. It is not synonymous with “good writing” in general. You would not write a literary analysis for an English class, even if it were based on psychoanalytic concepts, in APA style. You would write it in Modern Language Association (MLA) style instead. And you would not write a newspaper article, even if it were about a new breakthrough in behavioral neuroscience, in APA style. You would write it in Associated Press (AP) style instead. At the same time, you would not write an empirical research report in MLA style, in AP style, or in the style of a romance novel, an e-mail to a friend, or a shopping list. You would write it in APA style. Part of being a good writer in general is adopting a style that is appropriate to the writing task at hand, and for writing about psychological research, this is APA style.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">The Levels of APA Style</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="price_1.0-ch11_s01_s02_p01">Because APA style consists of a large number and variety of guidelines—the <em class="emphasis">Publication Manual</em> is nearly 300 pages long—it can be useful to think about it in terms of three basic levels. The first is the overall <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">organization</a><span class="glossdef">The most general level of APA style. It refers to the organization of a research article.</span></span> of an article (which is covered in <a class="xref" href="price_1.0-ch02#price_1.0-ch02">Chapter 2 "Getting Started in Research"</a> of the <em class="emphasis">Publication Manual</em>). Empirical research reports, in particular, have several distinct sections that always appear in the same order:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="price_1.0-ch11_s01_s02_l01">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Title page.</strong> Presents the article title and author names and affiliations.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Abstract.</strong> Summarizes the research.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Introduction.</strong> Describes previous research and the rationale for the current study.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Method.</strong> Describes how the study was conducted.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Results.</strong> Describes the results of the study.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Discussion.</strong> Summarizes the study and discusses its implications.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">References.</strong> Lists the references cited throughout the article.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="para editable block" id="price_1.0-ch11_s01_s02_p02">The second level of APA style can be referred to as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">high-level style</a><span class="glossdef">The second-most general level of APA style. It refers to general guidelines for the clear expression of ideas.</span></span> (covered in <a class="xref" href="price_1.0-ch03#price_1.0-ch03">Chapter 3 "Research Ethics"</a> of the <em class="emphasis">Publication Manual</em>), which includes guidelines for the clear expression of ideas. There are two important themes here. One is that APA-style writing is formal rather than informal. It adopts a tone that is appropriate for communicating with professional colleagues—other researchers and practitioners—who share an interest in the topic. Beyond this shared interest, however, these colleagues are not necessarily similar to the writer or to each other. A graduate student in California might be writing an article that will be read by a young psychotherapist in New York City and a respected professor of psychology in Tokyo. Thus formal writing avoids slang, contractions, pop culture references, humor, and other elements that would be acceptable in talking with a friend or in writing informally.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="price_1.0-ch11_s01_s02_p03">The second theme of high-level APA style is that it is straightforward. This means that it communicates ideas as simply and clearly as possible, putting the focus on the ideas themselves and not on how they are communicated. Thus APA-style writing minimizes literary devices such as metaphor, imagery, irony, suspense, and so on. Again, humor is kept to a minimum. Sentences are short and direct. Technical terms must be used, but they are used to improve communication, not simply to make the writing sound more “scientific.” For example, if participants immersed their hands in a bucket of ice water, it is better just to write this than to write that they “were subjected to a pain-inducement apparatus.” At the same time, however, there is no better way to communicate that a between-subjects design was used than to use the term “between-subjects design.”</p>

            <h3 class="title">APA Style and the Values of Psychology</h3>
            <p class="para" id="price_1.0-ch11_s01_s02_p04">Robert Madigan and his colleagues have argued that APA style has a purpose that often goes unrecognized (Madigan, Johnson, &amp; Linton, 1995).<span class="footnote" id="price_1.0-fn11_004">Madigan, R., Johnson, S., &amp; Linton, P. (1995). The language of psychology: APA style as epistemology. <em class="emphasis">American Psychologist, 50</em>, 428–436.</span> Specifically, it promotes psychologists’ scientific values and assumptions. From this perspective, many features of APA style that at first seem arbitrary actually make good sense. Following are several features of APA-style writing and the scientific values or assumptions they reflect.</p>

                            <td>Researchers tend to “hedge” their conclusions, e.g., “The results <em class="emphasis">suggest</em> that…”</td>

        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="price_1.0-ch11_s01_s02_p05">Another important element of high-level APA style is the avoidance of language that is biased against particular groups. This is not only to avoid offending people—why would you want to offend people who are interested in your work?—but also for the sake of scientific objectivity and accuracy. For example, the term <em class="emphasis">sexual orientation</em> should be used instead of <em class="emphasis">sexual preference</em> because people do not generally experience their orientation as a “preference,” nor is it as easily changeable as this term suggests (Committee on Lesbian and Gay Concerns, APA, 1991).<span class="footnote" id="price_1.0-fn11_005">Committee on Lesbian and Gay Concerns, American Psychological Association. (1991). Avoiding heterosexual bias in language. <em class="emphasis">American Psychologist, 46</em>, 973–974. Retrieved from <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.apa.org/pi/lgbt/resources/language.aspx">http://www.apa.org/pi/lgbt/resources/language.aspx</a></span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="price_1.0-ch11_s01_s02_p06">The general principles for avoiding biased language are fairly simple. First, be sensitive to labels by avoiding terms that are offensive or have negative connotations. This includes terms that identify people with a disorder or other problem they happen to have. For example, <em class="emphasis">patients with schizophrenia</em> is better than <em class="emphasis">schizophrenics</em>. Second, use more specific terms rather than more general ones. For example, <em class="emphasis">Mexican Americans</em> is better than <em class="emphasis">Hispanics</em> if everyone in the group is, in fact, Mexican American. Third, avoid objectifying research participants. Instead, acknowledge their active contribution to the research. For example, “The <em class="emphasis">students completed</em> the questionnaire” is better than “The <em class="emphasis">subjects were administered</em> the questionnaire.” Note that this principle also makes for clearer, more engaging writing. <a class="xref" href="#price_1.0-ch11_s01_s02_t01">Table 11.1 "Examples of Avoiding Biased Language"</a> shows several more examples that follow these general principles.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="price_1.0-ch11_s01_s03_p01">Because science is a large-scale collaboration among researchers, references to the work of other researchers are extremely important.

The references appear in a reference list at the end of the article or book chapter. “Reference” can also mean the work itself.</span></span> to all the works cited in the text (and <em class="emphasis">only</em> the works cited in the text). The reference list begins on its own page, with the heading “References,” centered in upper and lower case. The references themselves are then listed alphabetically according to the last names of the first named author for each citation. (As in the rest of an APA-style manuscript, <em class="emphasis">everything</em> is double-spaced.) Many different kinds of works might be cited in APA-style articles and book chapters, including magazine articles, websites, government documents, and even television shows. Of course, you should consult the <em class="emphasis">Publication Manual</em> or Online APA Style Resources for details on how to format them. Here we will focus on formatting references for the three most common kinds of works cited in APA style: journal articles, books, and book chapters.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="price_1.0-ch11_s01_s03_s01_s01_p05">There are several things to notice here. The reference includes a hanging indent. That is, the first line of the reference is not indented but all subsequent lines are. The authors’ names appear in the same order as on the article, which reflects the authors’ relative contributions to the research. Only the authors’ last names and initials appear, and the names are separated by commas with an ampersand (&amp;) between the last two. This is true even when there are only two authors. Only the first word of the article title is capitalized. The only exceptions are for words that are proper nouns or adjectives (e.g., “Freudian”) or if there is a subtitle, in which case the first word of the subtitle is also capitalized. In the journal title, however, all the important words are capitalized. The journal title and volume number are italicized. At the very end of the reference is the digital object identifier (DOI), which provides a permanent link to the location of the article on the Internet. Include this if it is available. It can generally be found in the record for the item on an electronic database (e.g., PsycINFO) and is usually displayed on the first page of the published article.</p>

Only the first word of a book title is capitalized (with the exceptions noted for article titles), and the entire title is italicized. For a chapter in an edited book, the page numbers of the chapter appear in parentheses after the book title with the abbreviation “pp.” Finally, both formats end with the location of publication and the publisher, separated by a colon.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Reference Citations</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="price_1.0-ch11_s01_s03_s02_p01">When you refer to another researcher’s idea, you must include a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">reference citation</a><span class="glossdef">In the text of an APA-style article or book chapter, a mention of a specific reference. APA-style reference citations provide the authors’ last names and the year of publication.</span></span> (in the text) to the work in which that idea originally appeared and a full reference to that work in the reference list. What counts as an idea that must be cited? In general, this includes phenomena discovered by other researchers, theories they have developed, hypotheses they have derived, and specific methods they have used (e.g., specific questionnaires or stimulus materials). Citations should also appear for factual information that is not common knowledge so that other researchers can check that information for themselves. For example, in an article on the effect of cell phone usage on driving ability, the writer might cite official statistics on the number of cell phone–related accidents that occur each year. Among the ideas that do not need citations are widely shared methodological and statistical concepts (e.g., between-subjects design, <em class="emphasis">t</em> test) and statements that are so broad that they would be difficult for anyone to argue with (e.g., “Working memory plays a role in many daily activities.”). Be careful, though, because “common knowledge” about human behavior is often incorrect. Therefore, when in doubt, find an appropriate reference to cite or remove the questionable assertion.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="price_1.0-ch11_s01_s03_s02_p02">When you cite a work in the text of your manuscript, there are two ways to do it. Both include only the last names of the authors and the year of publication. The first method is to use the authors’ last names in the sentence (with no first names or initials) followed immediately by the year of publication in parentheses. Here are some examples:</p>
            <span class="blockquote block" id="price_1.0-ch11_s01_s03_s02_bl01">
                <p class="para editable" id="price_1.0-ch11_s01_s03_s02_p03">Burger (2008) conducted a replication of Milgram’s (1963) original obedience study.</p>
            </span>
            <span class="blockquote block" id="price_1.0-ch11_s01_s03_s02_bl02">
                <p class="para editable" id="price_1.0-ch11_s01_s03_s02_p04">Although many people believe that women are more talkative than men, Mehl, Vazire, Ramirez-Esparza, Slatcher, and Pennebaker (2007) found essentially no difference in the number of words spoken by male and female college students.</p>
            </span>
            <p class="para editable block" id="price_1.0-ch11_s01_s03_s02_p05">Notice several things. First, the authors’ names are treated grammatically as names of people, not as things. It is better to write “a replication of Milgram’s (1963) study” than “a replication of Milgram (1963).” Second, when there are two authors the names are not separated by commas, but when there are three or more authors they are. Third, the word <em class="emphasis">and</em> (rather than an ampersand) is used to join the authors’ names. Fourth, the year follows immediately after the final author’s name. An additional point, which is not illustrated in these examples but is illustrated in the sample paper in <a class="xref" href="price_1.0-ch11_s02#price_1.0-ch11_s02">Section 11.2 "Writing a Research Report in American Psychological Association (APA) Style"</a>, is that the year only needs to be included the first time a particular work is cited in the same paragraph.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="price_1.0-ch11_s01_s03_s02_p06">The second way to cite an article or a book chapter is parenthetically—including the authors’ last names and the year of publication in parentheses following the idea that is being credited. Here are some examples:</p>
            <span class="blockquote block" id="price_1.0-ch11_s01_s03_s02_bl03">
                <p class="para editable" id="price_1.0-ch11_s01_s03_s02_p07">People can be surprisingly obedient to authority figures (Burger, 2008; Milgram, 1963).</p>
            </span>
            <span class="blockquote block" id="price_1.0-ch11_s01_s03_s02_bl04">
                <p class="para editable" id="price_1.0-ch11_s01_s03_s02_p08">Recent evidence suggests that men and women are similarly talkative (Mehl, Vazire, Ramirez-Esparza, Slatcher, &amp; Pennebaker, 2007).</p>
            </span>
            <p class="para editable block" id="price_1.0-ch11_s01_s03_s02_p09">One thing to notice about such parenthetical citations is that they are often placed at the end of the sentence, which minimizes their disruption to the flow of that sentence. In contrast to the first way of citing a work, this way always includes the year—even when the citation is given multiple times in the same paragraph. Notice also that when there are multiple citations in the same set of parentheses, they are organized alphabetically by the name of the first author and separated by semicolons.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="price_1.0-ch11_s01_s03_s02_p10">There are no strict rules for deciding which of the two citation styles to use. Most articles and book chapters contain a mixture of the two. In general, however, the first approach works well when you want to emphasize the person who conducted the research—for example, if you were comparing the theories of two prominent researchers. It also works well when you are describing a particular study in detail. The second approach works well when you are discussing a general idea and especially when you want to include multiple citations for the same idea.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="price_1.0-ch11_s01_s03_s02_p11">The third most common error in <a class="xref" href="#price_1.0-ch11_s01_s02_t02">Table 11.2 "Top 10 APA Style Errors"</a> has to do with the use of <em class="emphasis">et al.</em> This is an abbreviation for the Latin term <em class="emphasis">et alia</em>, which means “and others.” In APA style, if an article or a book chapter has more than two authors, you should include all their names when you first cite that work. After that, however, you should use the first author’s name followed by “et al.” Here are some examples:</p>
            <span class="blockquote block" id="price_1.0-ch11_s01_s03_s02_bl05">
                <p class="para editable" id="price_1.0-ch11_s01_s03_s02_p12">Recall that Mehl et al. (2007) found that women and men spoke about the same number of words per day on average.</p>
            </span>
            <span class="blockquote block" id="price_1.0-ch11_s01_s03_s02_bl06">
                <p class="para editable" id="price_1.0-ch11_s01_s03_s02_p13">There is a strong positive correlation between the number of daily hassles and the number of symptoms people experience (Kanner et al., 1981).</p>
            </span>
            <p class="para editable block" id="price_1.0-ch11_s01_s03_s02_p14">Notice that there is no comma between the first author’s name and “et al.” Notice also that there is no period after “et” but there is one after “al.” This is because “et” is a complete word and “al.” is an abbreviation for the word <em class="emphasis">alia</em>.</p>
