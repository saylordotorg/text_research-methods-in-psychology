            <p class="para editable block" id="price_1.0-ch11_s02_s01_s01_p01">An APA-style research report begins with a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">title page</a><span class="glossdef">The first page of an APA-style manuscript, containing the title, author names and affiliations, and author note.</span></span>. The title is centered in the upper half of the page, with each important word capitalized. The title should clearly and concisely (in about 12 words or fewer) communicate the primary variables and research questions. This sometimes requires a main title followed by a subtitle that elaborates on the main title, in which case the main title and subtitle are separated by a colon. Here are some titles from recent issues of professional journals published by the American Psychological Association.</p>

                <p class="para" id="price_1.0-ch11_s02_s01_s01_p03">In some areas of psychology, the titles of many empirical research reports are informal in a way that is perhaps best described as “cute.” They usually take the form of a play on words or a well-known expression that relates to the topic under study. Here are some examples from recent issues of the <em class="emphasis">Journal of Personality and Social Psychology</em>.</p>

The heading at the top of this page is the full title of the manuscript, with each important word capitalized as on the title page. The introduction includes three distinct subsections, although these are typically not identified by separate headings. The opening introduces the research question and explains why it is interesting, the literature review discusses relevant previous research, and the closing restates the research question and comments on the method used to answer it.</p>

To capture the reader’s attention, researcher Daryl Bem recommends starting with general observations about the topic under study, expressed in ordinary language (not technical jargon)—observations that are about people and their behavior (not about researchers or their research; Bem, 2003).<span class="footnote" id="price_1.0-fn11_007">Bem, D.

For example, the person who knows that he or she enjoys smoking but believes it to be unhealthy may experience discomfort arising from the inconsistency or disharmony between these two thoughts or cognitions. This feeling of discomfort was called cognitive dissonance by social psychologist Leon Festinger (1957), who suggested that individuals will be motivated to remove this dissonance in whatever way they can (p. 191).</p>
                </span>
                <p class="para editable block" id="price_1.0-ch11_s02_s01_s02_s01_p05">After capturing the reader’s attention, the opening should go on to introduce the research question and explain why it is interesting. Will the answer fill a gap in the literature? Will it provide a test of an important theory? Does it have practical implications? Giving readers a clear sense of what the research is about and why they should care about it will motivate them to continue reading the literature review—and will help them make sense of it.</p>

                    <p class="para" id="price_1.0-ch11_s02_s01_s02_s01_p06">Researcher Larry Jacoby reported several studies showing that a word that people see or hear repeatedly can seem more familiar even when they do not recall the repetitions—and that this tendency is especially pronounced among older adults.

During an orientation meeting at the nursing home, the rules and regulations were explained, one of which regarded the dining room. The dining room was described as similar to a fine restaurant except that tipping was not required. The absence of tipping was a central theme in the orientation lecture, mentioned frequently to emphasize the quality of care along with the advantages of having paid in advance. At the end of the meeting, the friend’s mother was asked whether she had any questions. She replied that she only had one question: “Should I tip?” (p. 3).</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">The Literature Review</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="price_1.0-ch11_s02_s01_s03_p01">Immediately after the opening comes the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">literature review</a><span class="glossdef">A written summary of previous research on a topic. It constitutes the bulk of the introduction of an APA-style empirical research report.</span></span>, which describes relevant previous research on the topic and can be anywhere from several paragraphs to several pages in length. However, the literature review is not simply a list of past studies. Instead, it constitutes a kind of argument for why the research question is worth addressing. By the end of the literature review, readers should be convinced that the research question makes sense and that the present study is a logical next step in the ongoing research process.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="price_1.0-ch11_s02_s01_s03_p02">Like any effective argument, the literature review must have some kind of structure. For example, it might begin by describing a phenomenon in a general way along with several studies that demonstrate it, then describing two or more competing theories of the phenomenon, and finally presenting a hypothesis to test one or more of the theories. Or it might describe one phenomenon, then describe another phenomenon that seems inconsistent with the first one, then propose a theory that resolves the inconsistency, and finally present a hypothesis to test that theory. In applied research, it might describe a phenomenon or theory, then describe how that phenomenon or theory applies to some important real-world situation, and finally suggest a way to test whether it does, in fact, apply to that situation.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="price_1.0-ch11_s02_s01_s03_p03">Looking at the literature review in this way emphasizes a few things. First, it is extremely important to start with an outline of the main points that you want to make, organized in the order that you want to make them. The basic structure of your argument, then, should be apparent from the outline itself. Second, it is important to emphasize the structure of your argument in your writing. One way to do this is to begin the literature review by summarizing your argument even before you begin to make it. “In this article, I will describe two apparently contradictory phenomena, present a new theory that has the potential to resolve the apparent contradiction, and finally present a novel hypothesis to test the theory.” Another way is to open each paragraph with a sentence that summarizes the main point of the paragraph and links it to the preceding points. These opening sentences provide the “transitions” that many beginning researchers have difficulty with. Instead of beginning a paragraph by launching into a description of a previous study, such as “Williams (2004) found that…,” it is better to start by indicating something about why you are describing this particular study. Here are some simple examples:</p>
            <span class="blockquote block" id="price_1.0-ch11_s02_s01_s03_bl01">
                <p class="para editable" id="price_1.0-ch11_s02_s01_s03_p04">Another example of this phenomenon comes from the work of Williams (2004).</p>
            </span>
            <span class="blockquote block" id="price_1.0-ch11_s02_s01_s03_bl02">
                <p class="para editable" id="price_1.0-ch11_s02_s01_s03_p05">Williams (2004) offers one explanation of this phenomenon.</p>
            </span>
            <span class="blockquote block" id="price_1.0-ch11_s02_s01_s03_bl03">
                <p class="para editable" id="price_1.0-ch11_s02_s01_s03_p06">An alternative perspective has been provided by Williams (2004).</p>
            </span>
            <span class="blockquote block" id="price_1.0-ch11_s02_s01_s03_bl04">
                <p class="para editable" id="price_1.0-ch11_s02_s01_s03_p07">We used a method based on the one used by Williams (2004).</p>
            </span>
            <p class="para editable block" id="price_1.0-ch11_s02_s01_s03_p08">Finally, remember that your goal is to construct an argument for why your research question is interesting and worth addressing—not necessarily why your favorite answer to it is correct. In other words, your literature review must be balanced. If you want to emphasize the generality of a phenomenon, then of course you should discuss various studies that have demonstrated it. However, if there are other studies that have failed to demonstrate it, you should discuss them too. Or if you are proposing a new theory, then of course you should discuss findings that are consistent with that theory. However, if there are other findings that are inconsistent with it, again, you should discuss them too. It is acceptable to argue that the <em class="emphasis">balance</em> of the research supports the existence of a phenomenon or is consistent with a theory (and that is usually the best that researchers in psychology can hope for), but it is not acceptable to <em class="emphasis">ignore</em> contradictory evidence. Besides, a large part of what makes a research question interesting is uncertainty about its answer.</p>
            <div class="section" id="price_1.0-ch11_s02_s01_s03_s01">
                <h2 class="title editable block">The Closing</h2>
                <p class="para editable block" id="price_1.0-ch11_s02_s01_s03_s01_p01">The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">closing</a><span class="glossdef">The last paragraph or two of the introduction of an APA-style empirical research report. It restates the research question and comments on the method.</span></span> of the introduction—typically the final paragraph or two—usually includes two important elements. The first is a clear statement of the main research question or hypothesis. This statement tends to be more formal and precise than in the opening and is often expressed in terms of operational definitions of the key variables. The second is a brief overview of the method and some comment on its appropriateness. Here, for example, is how Darley and Latané (1968)<span class="footnote" id="price_1.0-fn11_008">Darley, J. M., &amp; Latané, B. (1968). Bystander intervention in emergencies: Diffusion of responsibility. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 4</em>, 377–383.</span> concluded the introduction to their classic article on the bystander effect:</p>
                <span class="blockquote block" id="price_1.0-ch11_s02_s01_s03_s01_bl01">
                    <p class="para editable" id="price_1.0-ch11_s02_s01_s03_s01_p02">These considerations lead to the hypothesis that the more bystanders to an emergency, the less likely, or the more slowly, any one bystander will intervene to provide aid. To test this proposition it would be necessary to create a situation in which a realistic “emergency” could plausibly occur. Each subject should also be blocked from communicating with others to prevent his getting information about their behavior during the emergency. Finally, the experimental situation should allow for the assessment of the speed and frequency of the subjects’ reaction to the emergency. The experiment reported below attempted to fulfill these conditions (p. 378).</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="price_1.0-ch11_s02_s01_s03_s01_p03">Thus the introduction leads smoothly into the next major section of the article—the method section.</p>

At minimum, it includes a participants subsection and a design and procedure subsections.</span></span> is where you describe how you conducted your study. An important principle for writing a method section is that it should be clear and detailed enough that other researchers could replicate the study by following your “recipe.” This means that it must describe all the important elements of the study—basic demographic characteristics of the participants, how they were recruited, whether they were randomly assigned, how the variables were manipulated or measured, how counterbalancing was accomplished, and so on. At the same time, it should avoid irrelevant details such as the fact that the study was conducted in Classroom 37B of the Industrial Technology Building or that the questionnaire was double-sided and completed using pencils.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="price_1.0-ch11_s02_s01_s04_p02">The method section begins immediately after the introduction ends with the heading “Method” (not “Methods”) centered on the page.

In the first, the participants section is followed by a design and procedure subsection, which describes the rest of the method. This works well for methods that are relatively simple and can be described adequately in a few paragraphs. In the second approach, the participants section is followed by separate design and procedure subsections. This works well when both the design and the procedure are relatively complicated and each requires multiple paragraphs.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="price_1.0-ch11_s02_s01_s04_p04">What is the difference between design and procedure? The design of a study is its overall structure. What were the independent and dependent variables? Was the independent variable manipulated, and if so, was it manipulated between or within subjects? How were the variables operationally defined? The procedure is how the study was carried out. It often works well to describe the procedure in terms of what the participants did rather than what the researchers did. For example, the participants gave their informed consent, read a set of instructions, completed a block of four practice trials, completed a block of 20 test trials, completed two questionnaires, and were debriefed and excused.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="price_1.0-ch11_s02_s01_s04_p05">In the third basic way to organize a method section, the participants subsection is followed by a materials subsection before the design and procedure subsections. This works well when there are complicated materials to describe. This might mean multiple questionnaires, written vignettes that participants read and respond to, perceptual stimuli, and so on. The heading of this subsection can be modified to reflect its content. Instead of “Materials,” it can be “Questionnaires,” “Stimuli,” and so on.</p>

Although it does not include the raw data—individual participants’ responses or scores—researchers should save their raw data and make them available to other researchers who request them. Some journals now make the raw data available online.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="price_1.0-ch11_s02_s01_s05_p02">Although there are no standard subsections, it is still important for the results section to be logically organized. Typically it begins with certain preliminary issues. One is whether any participants or responses were excluded from the analyses and why. The rationale for excluding data should be described clearly so that other researchers can decide whether it is appropriate. A second preliminary issue is how multiple responses were combined to produce the primary variables in the analyses. For example, if participants rated the attractiveness of 20 stimulus people, you might have to explain that you began by computing the mean attractiveness rating for each participant. Or if they recalled as many items as they could from study list of 20 words, did you count the number correctly recalled, compute the percentage correctly recalled, or perhaps compute the number correct minus the number incorrect? A third preliminary issue is the reliability of the measures. This is where you would present test-retest correlations, Cronbach’s α, or other statistics to show that the measures are consistent across time and across items. A final preliminary issue is whether the manipulation was successful. This is where you would report the results of any manipulation checks.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="price_1.0-ch11_s02_s01_s05_p03">The results section should then tackle the primary research questions, one at a time. Again, there should be a clear organization. One approach would be to answer the most general questions and then proceed to answer more specific ones. Another would be to answer the main question first and then to answer secondary ones. Regardless, Bem (2003)<span class="footnote" id="price_1.0-fn11_009">Bem, D. J. (2003). Writing the empirical journal article. In J. M. Darley, M. P. Zanna, &amp; H. R. Roediger III (Eds.), <em class="emphasis">The compleat academic: A practical guide for the beginning social scientist</em> (2nd ed.). Washington, DC: American Psychological Association.</span> suggests the following basic structure for discussing each new result:</p>
            <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="price_1.0-ch11_s02_s01_s05_l01">
                <li>Remind the reader of the research question.</li>
                <li>Give the answer to the research question in words.</li>
                <li>Present the relevant statistics.</li>
                <li>Qualify the answer if necessary.</li>
                <li>Summarize the result.</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="para editable block" id="price_1.0-ch11_s02_s01_s05_p04">Notice that only Step 3 necessarily involves numbers. The rest of the steps involve presenting the research question and the answer to it in words. In fact, the basic results should be clear even to a reader who skips over the numbers.</p>

        <div class="section" id="price_1.0-ch11_s02_s01_s06">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Discussion</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="price_1.0-ch11_s02_s01_s06_p01">The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">discussion</a><span class="glossdef">The final major section of an APA-style empirical research report. It typically includes a summary of the research, a discussion of theoretical and practical implications of the study, limitations of the study, and suggestions for future research.</span></span> is the last major section of the research report. Discussions usually consist of some combination of the following elements:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="price_1.0-ch11_s02_s01_s06_l01">
                <li>Summary of the research</li>
                <li>Theoretical implications</li>
                <li>Practical implications</li>
                <li>Limitations</li>
                <li>Suggestions for future research</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="para editable block" id="price_1.0-ch11_s02_s01_s06_p02">The discussion typically begins with a summary of the study that provides a clear answer to the research question. In a short report with a single study, this might require no more than a sentence. In a longer report with multiple studies, it might require a paragraph or even two. The summary is often followed by a discussion of the theoretical implications of the research. Do the results provide support for any existing theories? If not, how <em class="emphasis">can</em> they be explained? Although you do not have to provide a definitive explanation or detailed theory for your results, you at least need to outline one or more possible explanations. In applied research—and often in basic research—there is also some discussion of the practical implications of the research. How can the results be used, and by whom, to accomplish some real-world goal?</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="price_1.0-ch11_s02_s01_s06_p03">The theoretical and practical implications are often followed by a discussion of the study’s limitations. Perhaps there are problems with its internal or external validity. Perhaps the manipulation was not very effective or the measures not very reliable. Perhaps there is some evidence that participants did not fully understand their task or that they were suspicious of the intent of the researchers. Now is the time to discuss these issues and how they might have affected the results. But do not overdo it. All studies have limitations, and most readers will understand that a different sample or different measures might have produced different results. Unless there is good reason to think they <em class="emphasis">would</em> have, however, there is no reason to mention these routine issues. Instead, pick two or three limitations that seem like they could have influenced the results, explain how they could have influenced the results, and suggest ways to deal with them.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="price_1.0-ch11_s02_s01_s06_p04">Most discussions end with some suggestions for future research. If the study did not satisfactorily answer the original research question, what will it take to do so? What <em class="emphasis">new</em> research questions has the study raised? This part of the discussion, however, is not just a list of new questions. It is a discussion of two or three of the most important unresolved issues. This means identifying and clarifying each question, suggesting some alternative answers, and even suggesting ways they could be studied.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="price_1.0-ch11_s02_s01_s06_p05">Finally, some researchers are quite good at ending their articles with a sweeping or thought-provoking conclusion. Darley and Latané (1968),<span class="footnote" id="price_1.0-fn11_010">Darley, J. M., &amp; Latané, B. (1968). Bystander intervention in emergencies: Diffusion of responsibility. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 4</em>, 377–383.</span> for example, ended their article on the bystander effect by discussing the idea that whether people help others may depend more on the situation than on their personalities. Their final sentence is, “If people understand the situational forces that can make them hesitate to intervene, they may better overcome them” (p. 383). However, this kind of ending can be difficult to pull off. It can sound overreaching or just banal and end up detracting from the overall impact of the article. It is often better simply to end when you have made your final point (although you should avoid ending on a limitation).</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">References</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="price_1.0-ch11_s02_s01_s07_p01">The references section begins on a new page with the heading “References” centered at the top of the page. All references cited in the text are then listed in the format presented earlier. They are listed alphabetically by the last name of the first author. If two sources have the same first author, they are listed alphabetically by the last name of the second author. If all the authors are the same, then they are listed chronologically by the year of publication. Everything in the reference list is double-spaced both within and between references.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Appendixes, Tables, and Figures</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="price_1.0-ch11_s02_s01_s08_p01">Appendixes, tables, and figures come after the references. An <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">appendix</a><span class="glossdef">An optional section at the end of an APA-style manuscript used to present important supplemental material.</span></span> is appropriate for supplemental material that would interrupt the flow of the research report if it were presented within any of the major sections. An appendix could be used to present lists of stimulus words, questionnaire items, detailed descriptions of special equipment or unusual statistical analyses, or references to the studies that are included in a meta-analysis. Each appendix begins on a new page. If there is only one, the heading is “Appendix,” centered at the top of the page. If there is more than one, the headings are “Appendix A,” “Appendix B,” and so on, and they appear in the order they were first mentioned in the text of the report.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="price_1.0-ch11_s02_s01_s08_p02">After any appendixes come tables and then figures. Tables and figures are both used to present results. Figures can also be used to illustrate theories (e.g., in the form of a flowchart), display stimuli, outline procedures, and present many other kinds of information. Each table and figure appears on its own page. Tables are numbered in the order that they are first mentioned in the text (“Table 1,” “Table 2,” and so on). Figures are numbered the same way (“Figure 1,” “Figure 2,” and so on). A brief explanatory title, with the important words capitalized, appears above each table. Each figure is given a brief explanatory caption, where (aside from proper nouns or names) only the first word of each sentence is capitalized. More details on preparing APA-style tables and figures are presented later in the book.</p>
