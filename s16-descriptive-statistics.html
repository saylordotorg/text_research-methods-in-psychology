    <p class="para editable block" id="price_1.0-ch12_p01">At this point, we need to consider the basics of data analysis in psychological research in more detail. In this chapter, we focus on descriptive statistics—a set of techniques for summarizing and displaying the data from your sample. We look first at some of the most common techniques for describing single variables, followed by some of the most common techniques for describing statistical relationships between variables. We then look at how to present descriptive statistics in writing and also in the form of tables and graphs that would be appropriate for an American Psychological Association (APA)-style research report. We end with some practical advice for organizing and carrying out your analyses.</p>

Let us assume here that the data are quantitative and consist of scores on one or more variables for each of several study participants. Although in most cases the primary research question will be about one or more statistical relationships between variables, it is also important to describe each variable individually. For this reason, we begin by looking at some of the most common techniques for describing single variables.</p>

For example, in a sample of 100 college students, the distribution of the variable “number of siblings” might be such that 10 of them have no siblings, 30 have one sibling, 40 have two siblings, and so on. In the same sample, the distribution of the variable “sex” might be such that 44 have a score of “male” and 56 have a score of “female.”</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="price_1.0-ch12_s01_s01_s01_p01">One way to display the distribution of a variable is in a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">frequency table</a><span class="glossdef">A table for displaying the distribution of a variable.

The first column lists the values of the variable—the possible scores on the Rosenberg scale—and the second column lists the frequency of each score. This table shows that there were three students who had self-esteem scores of 24, five who had self-esteem scores of 23, and so on. From a frequency table like this, one can quickly see several important aspects of a distribution, including the range of scores (from 15 to 24), the most and least common scores (22 and 17, respectively), and any extreme scores that stand out from the rest.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="price_1.0-ch12_s01_s01_s01_p02">There are a few other points worth noting about frequency tables. First, the levels listed in the first column usually go from the highest at the top to the lowest at the bottom, and they usually do not extend beyond the highest and lowest scores in the data. For example, although scores on the Rosenberg scale can vary from a high of 30 to a low of 0, <a class="xref" href="#price_1.0-ch12_s01_s01_s01_t01">Table 12.1 "Frequency Table Showing a Hypothetical Distribution of Scores on the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale"</a> only includes levels from 24 to 15 because that range includes all the scores in this particular data set. Second, when there are many different scores across a wide range of values, it is often better to create a grouped frequency table, in which the first column lists ranges of values and the second column lists the frequency of scores in each range. <a class="xref" href="#price_1.0-ch12_s01_s01_s01_t02">Table 12.2 "A Grouped Frequency Table Showing a Hypothetical Distribution of Reaction Times"</a>, for example, is a grouped frequency table showing a hypothetical distribution of simple reaction times for a sample of 20 participants. In a grouped frequency table, the ranges must all be of equal width, and there are usually between five and 15 of them. Finally, frequency tables can also be used for categorical variables, in which case the levels are category labels. The order of the category labels is somewhat arbitrary, but they are often listed from the most frequent at the top to the least frequent at the bottom.</p>

When the variable is quantitative, as in this example, there is usually no gap between the bars. When the variable is categorical, however, there is usually a small gap between them.

        <p class="para editable block" id="price_1.0-ch12_s01_s02_p01">It is also useful to be able to describe the characteristics of a distribution more precisely. Here we look at how to do this in terms of two important characteristics: their central tendency and their variability.</p>

Looking back at <a class="xref" href="#price_1.0-ch12_s01_s01_s02_f01">Figure 12.1 "Histogram Showing the Distribution of Self-Esteem Scores Presented in "</a>, for example, we can see that the self-esteem scores tend to cluster around the values of 20 to 22. Here we will consider the three most common measures of central tendency: the mean, the median, and the mode.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="price_1.0-ch12_s01_s02_s01_p02">The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">mean</a><span class="glossdef">The most common measure of central tendency.

The value such that half the scores in the distribution are lower than it and half are higher than it.</span></span> is the middle score in the sense that half the scores in the distribution are less than it and half are greater than it. The simplest way to find the median is to organize the scores from lowest to highest and locate the score in the middle. Consider, for example, the following set of seven scores:</p>
            <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase">8 4 12 14 3 2 3</span></span>
            <p class="para editable block" id="price_1.0-ch12_s01_s02_s01_p05">To find the median, simply rearrange the scores from lowest to highest and locate the one in the middle.</p>
            <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase">2 3 3 <strong class="emphasis bold">4</strong> 8 12 14</span></span>
            <p class="para editable block" id="price_1.0-ch12_s01_s02_s01_p06">In this case, the median is 4 because there are three scores lower than 4 and three scores higher than 4. When there is an even number of scores, there are two scores in the middle of the distribution, in which case the median is the value halfway between them. For example, if we were to add a score of 15 to the preceding data set, there would be two scores (both 4 and 8) in the middle of the distribution, and the median would be halfway between them (6).</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="price_1.0-ch12_s01_s02_s01_p07">One final measure of central tendency is the mode. The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">mode</a><span class="glossdef">A measure of central tendency. The most frequently occurring score in the distribution.</span></span> is the most frequent score in a distribution. In the self-esteem distribution presented in <a class="xref" href="#price_1.0-ch12_s01_s01_s01_t01">Table 12.1 "Frequency Table Showing a Hypothetical Distribution of Scores on the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale"</a> and <a class="xref" href="#price_1.0-ch12_s01_s01_s02_f01">Figure 12.1 "Histogram Showing the Distribution of Self-Esteem Scores Presented in "</a>, for example, the mode is 22. More students had that score than any other. The mode is the only measure of central tendency that can also be used for categorical variables.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="price_1.0-ch12_s01_s02_s01_p08">In a distribution that is both unimodal and symmetrical, the mean, median, and mode will be very close to each other at the peak of the distribution. In a bimodal or asymmetrical distribution, the mean, median, and mode can be quite different. In a bimodal distribution, the mean and median will tend to be between the peaks, while the mode will be at the tallest peak. In a skewed distribution, the mean will differ from the median in the direction of the skew (i.e., the direction of the longer tail). For highly skewed distributions, the mean can be pulled so far in the direction of the skew that it is no longer a good measure of the central tendency of that distribution. Imagine, for example, a set of four simple reaction times of 200, 250, 280, and 250 milliseconds (ms). The mean is 245 ms. But the addition of one more score of 5,000 ms—perhaps because the participant was not paying attention—would raise the mean to 1,445 ms. Not only is this measure of central tendency greater than 80% of the scores in the distribution, but it also does not seem to represent the behavior of anyone in the distribution very well. This is why researchers often prefer the median for highly skewed distributions (such as distributions of reaction times).</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="price_1.0-ch12_s01_s02_s01_p09">Keep in mind, though, that you are not required to choose a single measure of central tendency in analyzing your data. Each one provides slightly different information, and all of them can be useful.</p>

That is, the range is 24 − 15 = 9. Although the range is easy to compute and understand, it can be misleading when there are outliers. Imagine, for example, an exam on which all the students scored between 90 and 100. It has a range of 10. But if there was a single student who scored 20, the range would increase to 80—giving the impression that the scores were quite variable when in fact only one student differed substantially from the rest.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="price_1.0-ch12_s01_s02_s02_p03">By far the most common measure of variability is the standard deviation.

That is, while the scores in the top distribution differ from the mean by about 1.69 units on average, the scores in the bottom distribution differ from the mean by about 4.30 units on average.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="price_1.0-ch12_s01_s02_s02_p04">Computing the standard deviation involves a slight complication.

The first column is a set of eight scores that has a mean of 5. The second column is the difference between each score and the mean. The third column is the square of each of these differences.

                <p class="para" id="price_1.0-ch12_s01_s02_s02_p06">If you have already taken a statistics course, you may have learned to divide the sum of the squared differences by <em class="emphasis">N</em> − 1 rather than by <em class="emphasis">N</em> when you compute the variance and standard deviation. Why is this?</p>
                <p class="para" id="price_1.0-ch12_s01_s02_s02_p07">By definition, the standard deviation is the square root of the mean of the squared differences. This implies dividing the sum of squared differences by <em class="emphasis">N</em>, as in the formula just presented. Computing the standard deviation this way is appropriate when your goal is simply to describe the variability in a sample. And learning it this way emphasizes that the variance is in fact the <em class="emphasis">mean</em> of the squared differences—and the standard deviation is the square root of this <em class="emphasis">mean</em>.</p>
                <p class="para" id="price_1.0-ch12_s01_s02_s02_p08">However, most calculators and software packages divide the sum of squared differences by <em class="emphasis">N</em> − 1. This is because the standard deviation of a sample tends to be a bit lower than the standard deviation of the population the sample was selected from. Dividing the sum of squares by <em class="emphasis">N</em> − 1 corrects for this tendency and results in a better estimate of the population standard deviation. Because researchers generally think of their data as representing a sample selected from a larger population—and because they are generally interested in drawing conclusions about the population—it makes sense to routinely apply this correction.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="price_1.0-ch12_s01_s02_s03_p01">In many situations, it is useful to have a way to describe the location of an individual score within its distribution. One approach is the percentile rank. The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">percentile rank</a><span class="glossdef">A measure of the location of a score within its distribution. The percentage of scores below a particular score.</span></span> of a score is the percentage of scores in the distribution that are lower than that score. Consider, for example, the distribution in <a class="xref" href="#price_1.0-ch12_s01_s01_s01_t01">Table 12.1 "Frequency Table Showing a Hypothetical Distribution of Scores on the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale"</a>. For any score in the distribution, we can find its percentile rank by counting the number of scores in the distribution that are lower than that score and converting that number to a percentage of the total number of scores. Notice, for example, that five of the students represented by the data in <a class="xref" href="#price_1.0-ch12_s01_s01_s01_t01">Table 12.1 "Frequency Table Showing a Hypothetical Distribution of Scores on the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale"</a> had self-esteem scores of 23. In this distribution, 32 of the 40 scores (80%) are lower than 23. Thus each of these students has a percentile rank of 80. (It can also be said that they scored “at the 80th percentile.”) Percentile ranks are often used to report the results of standardized tests of ability or achievement. If your percentile rank on a test of verbal ability were 40, for example, this would mean that you scored higher than 40% of the people who took the test.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="price_1.0-ch12_s01_s02_s03_p02">Another approach is the <em class="emphasis">z</em> score.

            <p class="para editable block" id="price_1.0-ch12_s01_s02_s03_p03">A <em class="emphasis">z</em> score indicates how far above or below the mean a raw score is, but it expresses this in terms of the standard deviation. For example, in a distribution of intelligence quotient (IQ) scores with a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15, an IQ score of 110 would have a <em class="emphasis">z</em> score of (110 − 100) / 15 = +0.67. In other words, a score of 110 is 0.67 standard deviations (approximately two thirds of a standard deviation) above the mean. Similarly, a raw score of 85 would have a <em class="emphasis">z</em> score of (85 − 100) / 15 = −1.00. In other words, a score of 85 is one standard deviation below the mean.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="price_1.0-ch12_s01_s02_s03_p04">There are several reasons that <em class="emphasis">z</em> scores are important. Again, they provide a way of describing where an individual’s score is located within a distribution and are sometimes used to report the results of standardized tests. They also provide one way of defining outliers. For example, outliers are sometimes defined as scores that have <em class="emphasis">z</em> scores less than −3.00 or greater than +3.00. In other words, they are defined as scores that are more than three standard deviations from the mean. Finally, <em class="emphasis">z</em> scores play an important role in understanding and computing other statistics, as we will see shortly.</p>

                    <li>The central tendency, or middle, of a distribution can be described precisely using three statistics—the mean, median, and mode. The mean is the sum of the scores divided by the number of scores, the median is the middle score, and the mode is the most common score.</li>
                    <li>The variability, or spread, of a distribution can be described precisely using the range and standard deviation. The range is the difference between the highest and lowest scores, and the standard deviation is roughly the average amount by which the scores differ from the mean.</li>
                    <li>The location of a score within its distribution can be described using percentile ranks or <em class="emphasis">z</em> scores. The percentile rank of a score is the percentage of scores below that score, and the <em class="emphasis">z</em> score is the difference between the score and the mean divided by the standard deviation.</li>

    <p class="para editable block" id="price_1.0-ch12_s02_p01">As we have seen throughout this book, most interesting research questions in psychology are about statistical relationships between variables. Recall that there is a statistical relationship between two variables when the average score on one differs systematically across the levels of the other. In this section, we revisit the two basic forms of statistical relationship introduced earlier in the book—differences between groups or conditions and relationships between quantitative variables—and we consider how to describe them in more detail.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="price_1.0-ch12_s02_s01_p01">Differences between groups or conditions are usually described in terms of the mean and standard deviation of each group or condition. For example, Thomas Ollendick and his colleagues conducted a study in which they evaluated two one-session treatments for simple phobias in children (Ollendick et al., 2009).<span class="footnote" id="price_1.0-fn12_001">Ollendick, T. H., Öst, L.-G., Reuterskiöld, L., Costa, N., Cederlund, R., Sirbu, C.,…Jarrett, M. A. (2009). One-session treatments of specific phobias in youth: A randomized clinical trial in the United States and Sweden. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 77</em>, 504–516.</span> They randomly assigned children with an intense fear (e.g., to dogs) to one of three conditions. In the exposure condition, the children actually confronted the object of their fear under the guidance of a trained therapist. In the education condition, they learned about phobias and some strategies for coping with them. In the waitlist control condition, they were waiting to receive a treatment after the study was over. The severity of each child’s phobia was then rated on a 1-to-8 scale by a clinician who did not know which treatment the child had received. (This was one of several dependent variables.) The mean fear rating in the education condition was 4.83 with a standard deviation of 1.52, while the mean fear rating in the exposure condition was 3.47 with a standard deviation of 1.77. The mean fear rating in the control condition was 5.56 with a standard deviation of 1.21. In other words, both treatments worked, but the exposure treatment worked better than the education treatment. As we have seen, differences between group or condition means can be presented in a bar graph like that in <a class="xref" href="#price_1.0-ch12_s02_s01_f01">Figure 12.5 "Bar Graph Showing Mean Clinician Phobia Ratings for Children in Two Treatment Conditions"</a>, where the heights of the bars represent the group or condition means.

        <p class="para editable block" id="price_1.0-ch12_s02_s01_p03">In this formula, it does not really matter which mean is <em class="emphasis">M</em><sub class="subscript">1</sub> and which is <em class="emphasis">M</em><sub class="subscript">2</sub>. If there is a treatment group and a control group, the treatment group mean is usually <em class="emphasis">M</em><sub class="subscript">1</sub> and the control group mean is <em class="emphasis">M</em><sub class="subscript">2</sub>. Otherwise, the larger mean is usually <em class="emphasis">M</em><sub class="subscript">1</sub> and the smaller mean <em class="emphasis">M</em><sub class="subscript">2</sub> so that Cohen’s <em class="emphasis">d</em> turns out to be positive. The standard deviation in this formula is usually a kind of average of the two group standard deviations called the pooled-within groups standard deviation. To compute the pooled within-groups standard deviation, add the sum of the squared differences for Group 1 to the sum of squared differences for Group 2, divide this by the sum of the two sample sizes, and then take the square root of that. Informally, however, the standard deviation of either group can be used instead.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="price_1.0-ch12_s02_s01_p04">Conceptually, Cohen’s <em class="emphasis">d</em> is the difference between the two means expressed in standard deviation units. (Notice its similarity to a <em class="emphasis">z</em> score, which expresses the difference between an individual score and a mean in standard deviation units.) A Cohen’s <em class="emphasis">d</em> of 0.50 means that the two group means differ by 0.50 standard deviations (half a standard deviation). A Cohen’s <em class="emphasis">d</em> of 1.20 means that they differ by 1.20 standard deviations. But how should we interpret these values in terms of the strength of the relationship or the size of the difference between the means? <a class="xref" href="#price_1.0-ch12_s02_s01_t01">Table 12.4 "Guidelines for Referring to Cohen’s "</a> presents some guidelines for interpreting Cohen’s <em class="emphasis">d</em> values in psychological research (Cohen, 1992).<span class="footnote" id="price_1.0-fn12_002">Cohen, J.

Thus a Cohen’s <em class="emphasis">d</em> value of 0.50 represents a medium-sized difference between two means, and a Cohen’s <em class="emphasis">d</em> value of 1.20 represents a very large difference in the context of psychological research. In the research by Ollendick and his colleagues, there was a large difference (<em class="emphasis">d</em> = 0.82) between the exposure and education conditions.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="price_1.0-ch12_s02_s01_p05">Cohen’s <em class="emphasis">d</em> is useful because it has the same meaning regardless of the variable being compared or the scale it was measured on. A Cohen’s <em class="emphasis">d</em> of 0.20 means that the two group means differ by 0.20 standard deviations whether we are talking about scores on the Rosenberg Self-Esteem scale, reaction time measured in milliseconds, number of siblings, or diastolic blood pressure measured in millimeters of mercury. Not only does this make it easier for researchers to communicate with each other about their results, it also makes it possible to combine and compare results across different studies using different measures.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="price_1.0-ch12_s02_s01_p06">Be aware that the term <em class="emphasis">effect size</em> can be misleading because it suggests a causal relationship—that the difference between the two means is an “effect” of being in one group or condition as opposed to another. Imagine, for example, a study showing that a group of exercisers is happier on average than a group of nonexercisers, with an “effect size” of <em class="emphasis">d</em> = 0.35. If the study was an experiment—with participants randomly assigned to exercise and no-exercise conditions—then one could conclude that exercising caused a small to medium-sized increase in happiness. If the study was correlational, however, then one could conclude only that the exercisers were happier than the nonexercisers by a small to medium-sized amount. In other words, simply calling the difference an “effect size” does not make the relationship a causal one.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="price_1.0-ch12_s02_s01_s01_p05">As we saw earlier in the book, the strength of a correlation between quantitative variables is typically measured using a statistic called Pearson’s <em class="emphasis">r</em>. As <a class="xref" href="#price_1.0-ch12_s02_s01_s01_f04">Figure 12.10 "Pearson’s "</a> shows, its possible values range from −1.00, through zero, to +1.00. A value of 0 means there is no relationship between the two variables. In addition to his guidelines for interpreting Cohen’s <em class="emphasis">d</em>, Cohen offered guidelines for interpreting Pearson’s <em class="emphasis">r</em> in psychological research (see <a class="xref" href="#price_1.0-ch12_s02_s01_t01">Table 12.4 "Guidelines for Referring to Cohen’s "</a>). Values near ±.10 are considered small, values near ± .30 are considered medium, and values near ±.50 are considered large. Notice that the sign of Pearson’s <em class="emphasis">r</em> is unrelated to its strength. Pearson’s <em class="emphasis">r</em> values of +.30 and −.30, for example, are equally strong; it is just that one represents a moderate positive relationship and the other a moderate negative relationship. Like Cohen’s <em class="emphasis">d</em>, Pearson’s <em class="emphasis">r</em> is also referred to as a measure of “effect size” even though the relationship may not be a causal one.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="price_1.0-ch12_s02_s01_s01_p06">The computations for Pearson’s <em class="emphasis">r</em> are more complicated than those for Cohen’s <em class="emphasis">d</em>. Although you may never have to do them by hand, it is still instructive to see how. Computationally, Pearson’s <em class="emphasis">r</em> is the “mean cross-product of <em class="emphasis">z</em> scores.” To compute it, one starts by transforming all the scores to <em class="emphasis">z</em> scores. For the <em class="emphasis">X</em> variable, subtract the mean of <em class="emphasis">X</em> from each score and divide each difference by the standard deviation of <em class="emphasis">X</em>. For the <em class="emphasis">Y</em> variable, subtract the mean of <em class="emphasis">Y</em> from each score and divide each difference by the standard deviation of <em class="emphasis">Y</em>. Then, for each individual, multiply the two <em class="emphasis">z</em> scores together to form a cross-product. Finally, take the mean of the cross-products. The formula looks like this:</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="price_1.0-ch12_s02_s01_s01_p07"><a class="xref" href="#price_1.0-ch12_s02_s01_s01_t01">Table 12.5 "Sample Computations for Pearson’s "</a> illustrates these computations for a small set of data. The first column lists the scores for the <em class="emphasis">X</em> variable, which has a mean of 4.00 and a standard deviation of 1.90. The second column is the <em class="emphasis">z</em> score for each of these raw scores. The third and fourth columns list the raw scores for the <em class="emphasis">Y</em> variable, which has a mean of 40 and a standard deviation of 11.78, and the corresponding <em class="emphasis">z</em> scores. The fifth column lists the cross-products. For example, the first one is 0.00 multiplied by −0.85, which is equal to 0.00. The second is 1.58 multiplied by 1.19, which is equal to 1.88. The mean of these cross-products, shown at the bottom of that column, is Pearson’s <em class="emphasis">r</em>, which in this case is +.53. There are other formulas for computing Pearson’s <em class="emphasis">r</em> by hand that may be quicker. This approach, however, is much clearer in terms of communicating conceptually what Pearson’s <em class="emphasis">r</em> is.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="price_1.0-ch12_s02_s01_s01_p08">There are two common situations in which the value of Pearson’s <em class="emphasis">r</em> can be misleading. One is when the relationship under study is nonlinear. Even though <a class="xref" href="#price_1.0-ch12_s02_s01_s01_f03">Figure 12.9 "A Hypothetical Nonlinear Relationship Between How Much Sleep People Get per Night and How Depressed They Are"</a> shows a fairly strong relationship between depression and sleep, Pearson’s <em class="emphasis">r</em> would be close to zero because the points in the scatterplot are not well fit by a single straight line. This means that it is important to make a scatterplot and confirm that a relationship is approximately linear before using Pearson’s <em class="emphasis">r</em>. The other is when one or both of the variables have a limited range in the sample relative to the population. This is referred to as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">restriction of range</a><span class="glossdef">When the data used to assess a statistical relationship include a limited range of scores on either the <em class="emphasis">X</em> or <em class="emphasis">Y</em> variable, relative to the range of scores in the population. This makes the statistical relationships appear weaker than it actually is.</span></span>. Assume, for example, that there is a strong negative correlation between people’s age and their enjoyment of hip hop music as shown by the scatterplot in <a class="xref" href="#price_1.0-ch12_s02_s01_s01_f05">Figure 12.11 "Hypothetical Data Showing How a Strong Overall Correlation Can Appear to Be Weak When One Variable Has a Restricted Range"</a>. Pearson’s <em class="emphasis">r</em> here is −.77. However, if we were to collect data only from 18- to 24-year-olds—represented by the shaded area of <a class="xref" href="#price_1.0-ch12_s02_s01_s01_f05">Figure 12.11 "Hypothetical Data Showing How a Strong Overall Correlation Can Appear to Be Weak When One Variable Has a Restricted Range"</a>—then the relationship would seem to be quite weak. In fact, Pearson’s <em class="emphasis">r</em> for this restricted range of ages is 0. It is a good idea, therefore, to design studies to avoid restriction of range. For example, if age is one of your primary variables, then you can plan to collect data from people of a wide range of ages. Because restriction of range is not always anticipated or easily avoidable, however, it is good practice to examine your data for possible restriction of range and to interpret Pearson’s <em class="emphasis">r</em> in light of it. (There are also statistical methods to correct Pearson’s <em class="emphasis">r</em> for restriction of range, but they are beyond the scope of this book).</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Presenting Descriptive Statistics in Writing</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="price_1.0-ch12_s03_s01_p01">When you have a small number of results to report, it is often most efficient to write them out. There are a few important APA style guidelines here. First, statistical results are always presented in the form of numerals rather than words and are usually rounded to two decimal places (e.g., “2.00” rather than “two” or “2”). They can be presented either in the narrative description of the results or parenthetically—much like reference citations. Here are some examples:</p>
        <span class="blockquote block" id="price_1.0-ch12_s03_s01_bl01">
            <p class="para editable" id="price_1.0-ch12_s03_s01_p02">The mean age of the participants was 22.43 years with a standard deviation of 2.34.</p>

Notice also that it is especially important to use parallel construction to express similar or comparable results in similar ways. The third example is <em class="emphasis">much</em> better than the following nonparallel alternative:</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Presenting Descriptive Statistics in Graphs</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="price_1.0-ch12_s03_s02_p01">When you have a large number of results to report, you can often do it more clearly and efficiently with a graph. When you prepare graphs for an APA-style research report, there are some general guidelines that you should keep in mind. First, the graph should always add important information rather than repeat information that already appears in the text or in a table. (If a graph presents information more clearly or efficiently, then you should keep the graph and eliminate the text or table.) Second, graphs should be as simple as possible. For example, the <em class="emphasis">Publication Manual</em> discourages the use of color unless it is absolutely necessary (although color can still be an effective element in posters, slide show presentations, or textbooks.) Third, graphs should be interpretable on their own. A reader should be able to understand the basic result based only on the graph and its caption and should not have to refer to the text for an explanation.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="price_1.0-ch12_s03_s02_p02">There are also several more technical guidelines for graphs that include the following:</p>

The graph in <a class="xref" href="#price_1.0-ch12_s03_s02_s03_f01">Figure 12.14 "Sample APA-Style Scatterplot"</a> is an APA-style version of <a class="xref" href="price_1.0-ch12_s02#price_1.0-ch12_s02_s01_s01_f02">Figure 12.8 "Statistical Relationship Between Several College Students’ Scores on the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale Given on Two Occasions a Week Apart"</a>, which illustrates a few additional points. First, when the variables on the <em class="emphasis">x-</em>axis and <em class="emphasis">y</em>-axis are conceptually similar and measured on the same scale—as here, where they are measures of the same variable on two different occasions—this can be emphasized by making the axes the same length. Second, when two or more individuals fall at exactly the same point on the graph, one way this can be indicated is by offsetting the points slightly along the <em class="emphasis">x-</em>axis. Other ways are by displaying the number of individuals in parentheses next to the point or by making the point larger or darker in proportion to the number of individuals. Finally, the straight line that best fits the points in the scatterplot, which is called the regression line, can also be included.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="price_1.0-ch12_s03_s03_p01">Like graphs, tables can be used to present large amounts of information clearly and efficiently. The same general principles apply to tables as apply to graphs. They should add important information to the presentation of your results, be as simple as possible, and be interpretable on their own. Again, we focus here on tables for an APA-style manuscript.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="price_1.0-ch12_s03_s03_p02">The most common use of tables is to present several means and standard deviations—usually for complex research designs with multiple independent and dependent variables. <a class="xref" href="#price_1.0-ch12_s03_s03_f01">Figure 12.15 "Sample APA-Style Table Presenting Means and Standard Deviations"</a>, for example, shows the results of a hypothetical study similar to the one by MacDonald and Martineau (2002)<span class="footnote" id="price_1.0-fn12_006">MacDonald, T. K., &amp; Martineau, A. M. (2002). Self-esteem, mood, and intentions to use condoms: When does low self-esteem lead to risky health behaviors? <em class="emphasis">Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 38</em>, 299–306.</span> discussed in <a class="xref" href="price_1.0-ch05#price_1.0-ch05">Chapter 5 "Psychological Measurement"</a>. (The means in <a class="xref" href="#price_1.0-ch12_s03_s03_f01">Figure 12.15 "Sample APA-Style Table Presenting Means and Standard Deviations"</a> are the means reported by MacDonald and Martineau, but the standard errors are not). Recall that these researchers categorized participants as having low or high self-esteem, put them into a negative or positive mood, and measured their intentions to have unprotected sex. Although not mentioned in <a class="xref" href="price_1.0-ch05#price_1.0-ch05">Chapter 5 "Psychological Measurement"</a>, they also measured participants’ attitudes toward unprotected sex. Notice that the table includes horizontal lines spanning the entire table at the top and bottom, and just beneath the column headings. Furthermore, every column has a heading—including the leftmost column—and there are additional headings that span two or more columns that help to organize the information and present it more efficiently. Finally, notice that APA-style tables are numbered consecutively starting at 1 (Table 1, Table 2, and so on) and given a brief but clear and descriptive title.</p>

    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="price_1.0-ch12_s04_p01">Even when you understand the statistics involved, analyzing data can be a complicated process. It is likely that for each of several participants, there are data for several different variables: demographics such as sex and age, one or more independent variables, one or more dependent variables, and perhaps a manipulation check. Furthermore, the “raw” (unanalyzed) data might take several different forms—completed paper-and-pencil questionnaires, computer files filled with numbers or text, videos, or written notes—and these may have to be organized, coded, or combined in some way. There might even be missing, incorrect, or just “suspicious” responses that must be dealt with. In this section, we consider some practical advice to make this process as organized and efficient as possible.</p>
    <div class="section" id="price_1.0-ch12_s04_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Prepare Your Data for Analysis</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="price_1.0-ch12_s04_s01_p01">Whether your raw data are on paper or in a computer file (or both), there are a few things you should do before you begin analyzing them. First, be sure they do not include any information that might identify individual participants and be sure that you have a secure location where you can store the data and a separate secure location where you can store any consent forms. Unless the data are highly sensitive, a locked room or password-protected computer is usually good enough. It is also a good idea to make photocopies or backup files of your data and store them in yet another secure location—at least until the project is complete. Professional researchers usually keep a copy of their raw data and consent forms for several years in case questions about the procedure, the data, or participant consent arise after the project is completed.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="price_1.0-ch12_s04_s01_p02">Next, you should check your <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">raw data</a><span class="glossdef">Data in the form in which they were originally collected (e.g., completed questionnaires).</span></span> to make sure that they are complete and appear to have been accurately recorded (whether it was participants, yourself, or a computer program that did the recording). At this point, you might find that there are illegible or missing responses, or obvious misunderstandings (e.g., a response of “12” on a 1-to-10 rating scale). You will have to decide whether such problems are severe enough to make a participant’s data unusable. If information about the main independent or dependent variable is missing, or if several responses are missing or suspicious, you may have to exclude that participant’s data from the analyses. If you do decide to exclude any data, do not throw them away or delete them because you or another researcher might want to see them later. Instead, set them aside and keep notes about why you decided to exclude them because you will need to report this information.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="price_1.0-ch12_s04_s01_p03">Now you are ready to enter your data in a spreadsheet program or, if it is already in a computer file, to format it for analysis. You can use a general spreadsheet program like Microsoft Excel or a statistical analysis program like SPSS to create your <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">data file</a><span class="glossdef">A computer file that contains data formatted for statistical analysis.</span></span>. (Data files created in one program can usually be converted to work with other programs.) The most common format is for each row to represent a participant and for each column to represent a variable (with the variable name at the top of each column). A sample data file is shown in <a class="xref" href="#price_1.0-ch12_s04_s01_t01">Table 12.6 "Sample Data File"</a>. The first column contains participant identification numbers. This is followed by columns containing demographic information (sex and age), independent variables (mood, four self-esteem items, and the total of the four self-esteem items), and finally dependent variables (intentions and attitudes). Categorical variables can usually be entered as category labels (e.g., “M” and “F” for male and female) or as numbers (e.g., “0” for negative mood and “1” for positive mood). Although category labels are often clearer, some analyses might require numbers. SPSS allows you to enter numbers but also attach a category label to each number.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="price_1.0-ch12_s04_s01_p04">If you have multiple-response measures—such the self-esteem measure in <a class="xref" href="#price_1.0-ch12_s04_s01_t01">Table 12.6 "Sample Data File"</a>—you could combine the items by hand and then enter the total score in your spreadsheet. However, it is much better to enter each response as a separate variable in the spreadsheet—as with the self-esteem measure in <a class="xref" href="#price_1.0-ch12_s04_s01_t01">Table 12.6 "Sample Data File"</a>—and use the software to combine them (e.g., using the “AVERAGE” function in Excel or the “Compute” function in SPSS). Not only is this approach more accurate, but it allows you to detect and correct errors, to assess internal consistency, and to analyze individual responses if you decide to do so later.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="price_1.0-ch12_s04_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Preliminary Analyses</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="price_1.0-ch12_s04_s02_p01">Before turning to your primary research questions, there are often several preliminary analyses to conduct. For multiple-response measures, you should assess the internal consistency of the measure. Statistical programs like SPSS will allow you to compute Cronbach’s α or Cohen’s κ. If this is beyond your comfort level, you can still compute and evaluate a split-half correlation.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="price_1.0-ch12_s04_s02_p02">Next, you should analyze each important variable separately. (This is not necessary for manipulated independent variables, of course, because you as the researcher determined what the distribution would be.) Make histograms for each one, note their shapes, and compute the common measures of central tendency and variability. Be sure you understand what these statistics <em class="emphasis">mean</em> in terms of the variables you are interested in. For example, a distribution of self-report happiness ratings on a 1-to-10-point scale might be unimodal and negatively skewed with a mean of 8.25 and a standard deviation of 1.14. But what this <em class="emphasis">means</em> is that most participants rated themselves fairly high on the happiness scale, with a small number rating themselves noticeably lower.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="price_1.0-ch12_s04_s02_p03">Now is the time to identify outliers, examine them more closely, and decide what to do about them. You might discover that what at first appears to be an outlier is the result of a response being entered incorrectly in the data file, in which case you only need to correct the data file and move on. Alternatively, you might suspect that an outlier represents some other kind of error, misunderstanding, or lack of effort by a participant. For example, in a reaction time distribution in which most participants took only a few seconds to respond, a participant who took 3 minutes to respond would be an outlier. It seems likely that this participant did not understand the task (or at least was not paying very close attention). Also, including his or her reaction time would have a large impact on the mean and standard deviation for the sample. In situations like this, it can be justifiable to exclude the outlying response or participant from the analyses. If you do this, however, you should keep notes on which responses or participants you have excluded and why, and apply those same criteria consistently to every response and every participant. When you present your results, you should indicate how many responses or participants you excluded and the specific criteria that you used. And again, do not literally throw away or delete the data that you choose to exclude. Just set them aside because you or another researcher might want to see them later.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="price_1.0-ch12_s04_s02_p04">Keep in mind that outliers do not <em class="emphasis">necessarily</em> represent an error, misunderstanding, or lack of effort. They might represent truly extreme responses or participants. For example, in one large college student sample, the vast majority of participants reported having had fewer than 15 sexual partners, but there were also a few extreme scores of 60 or 70 (Brown &amp; Sinclair, 1999).<span class="footnote" id="price_1.0-fn12_009">Brown, N. R., &amp; Sinclair, R. C. (1999). Estimating number of lifetime sexual partners: Men and women do it differently. <em class="emphasis">The Journal of Sex Research, 36</em>, 292–297.</span> Although these scores might represent errors, misunderstandings, or even intentional exaggerations, it is also plausible that they represent honest and even accurate estimates. One strategy here would be to use the median and other statistics that are not strongly affected by the outliers. Another would be to analyze the data both including and excluding any outliers. If the results are essentially the same, which they often are, then it makes sense to leave the outliers. If the results differ depending on whether the outliers are included or excluded them, then both analyses can be reported and the differences between them discussed.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="price_1.0-ch12_s04_s03_p01">Finally, you are ready to answer your primary research questions. If you are interested in a difference between group or condition means, you can compute the relevant group or condition means and standard deviations, make a bar graph to display the results, and compute Cohen’s <em class="emphasis">d</em>. If you are interested in a correlation between quantitative variables, you can make a line graph or scatterplot (be sure to check for nonlinearity and restriction of range) and compute Pearson’s <em class="emphasis">r</em>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="price_1.0-ch12_s04_s03_p02">At this point, you should also explore your data for other interesting results that might provide the basis for future research (and material for the discussion section of your paper). Daryl Bem (2003) suggests that you</p>

If a datum suggests a new hypothesis, try to find additional evidence for it elsewhere in the data. If you see dim traces of interesting patterns, try to reorganize the data to bring them into bolder relief. If there are participants you don’t like, or trials, observers, or interviewers who gave you anomalous results, drop them (temporarily). Go on a fishing expedition for something—anything—interesting.

        <p class="para editable block" id="price_1.0-ch12_s04_s03_p04">It is important to be cautious, however, because complex sets of data are likely to include “patterns” that occurred entirely by chance. Thus results discovered while “fishing” should be replicated in at least one new study before being presented as new phenomena in their own right.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Understand Your Descriptive Statistics</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="price_1.0-ch12_s04_s04_p01">In the next chapter, we will consider inferential statistics—a set of techniques for deciding whether the results for your sample are likely to apply to the population. Although inferential statistics are important for reasons that will be explained shortly, beginning researchers sometimes forget that their descriptive statistics really tell “what happened” in their study. For example, imagine that a treatment group of 50 participants has a mean score of 34.32 (<em class="emphasis">SD</em> = 10.45), a control group of 50 participants has a mean score of 21.45 (<em class="emphasis">SD</em> = 9.22), and Cohen’s <em class="emphasis">d</em> is an extremely strong 1.31. Although conducting and reporting inferential statistics (like a <em class="emphasis">t</em> test) would certainly be a required part of any formal report on this study, it should be clear from the descriptive statistics alone that the treatment worked. Or imagine that a scatterplot shows an indistinct “cloud” of points and Pearson’s <em class="emphasis">r</em> is a trivial −.02. Again, although conducting and reporting inferential statistics would be a required part of any formal report on this study, it should be clear from the descriptive statistics alone that the variables are essentially unrelated. The point is that you should always be sure that you thoroughly understand your results at a descriptive level first, and then move on to the inferential statistics.</p>
